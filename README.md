# Emotion_Detection
 This Emotion detection system can detect moods in real time such as Happy or Sad. I have used this model in my Mood Based Music Recommendation System.In which I have generated a few commands based on mood and on that command a playlist will be suggested from the Spotify using the Spoipy API.
